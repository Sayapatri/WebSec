CSRF is a web vulnerability where the attacker can induces targeted victims to perform attacker's actions on the victim's
behalf.
how does it work
to perform the successful CSRF attack three conditions must be satisfied 
1. privileged actions
2. Cookie-based session handling.
3.doesn't contain any unpredictable parameter.

Lets take an example of an HTTP request where an user wants to change his email address//

POST /email/change HTTP/1.1 
Host: sthakapil.com.np
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 30
Cookie: session=yvthwsztyeQkAPzeQ5gHgTvlyxHfsAfE

email=admin@sthakapil.com.np


so as stated in no.1,this action subjets to attacker's interest where an user wants his email address to be changed
The application uses a session cookie to identify which user issued the request.and The attacker can easily determine the values of
the request parameters that are needed to perform the action. 

so now the attacker can construct a web page containing the malicious code which executes upon the user's interecation, 
<html>
    <body>
        <form action="https://sthakapil.com.np/email/change" method="POST">
            <input type="hidden" name="email" value="pwned@evil-user.net" />
        </form>
        <script>
            document.forms[0].submit();
        </script>
          </body>
</html>

 If a victim user visits the attacker's web page, the following will happen:..

    The attacker's page will trigger an HTTP request to the sthakapil.com.np web site.
    If the user is logged in to the sthakapil.com.np, their browser will automatically include their session cookie in the request
    (assuming SameSite cookies are not being used).
    The web site will process the request in the normal way, treat it as having been made by the victim user, and change their email address.
