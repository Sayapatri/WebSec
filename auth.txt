process of verifying the identity of a given user or client
authentication mechanisms arise in one of two ways:

The authentication mechanisms are weak because they fail to adequately protect against brute-force attacks.
Logic flaws or poor coding in the implementation allow the authentication mechanisms to be bypassed entirely by an attacker.
This is sometimes referred to as "broken authentication".

Vulnerabilities in multi-factor authentication
Log in to your own account. Your 2FA verification code will be sent to you by email. Click the Email client button to access your emails.
Go to your account page and make a note of the URL.
Log out of your account.
Log in using the victim's credentials.
When prompted for the verification code, manually change the URL to navigate to /my-account. The lab is solved when the page loads.


Bypassing two-factor authentication
At times, the implementation of two-factor authentication is flawed to the point where it can be bypassed entirely.

If the user is first prompted to enter a password, and then prompted to enter a verification code on a separate page, the user is effectively in a "logged in" state before they have entered the verification code. In this case, it is worth testing to see if you can directly skip to "logged-in only" pages after completing the first authentication step. Occasionally, you will find that a website doesn't actually check whether or not you completed the second step before loading the page.
