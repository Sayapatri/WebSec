Business logic vulnerabilities are flaws in the design and implementation of an application that 
allow an attacker to elicit unintended behavior. This potentially enables attackers to manipulate legitimate functionality to achieve a malicious goal. 
These flaws are generally the result of failing to anticipate unusual application states that may occur and, consequently, failing to handle them safely.

>>Business logic vulnerabilities often arise because the design and development teams make flawed assumptions about how users will interact with the application. <<
Logic flaws are particularly common in overly complicated systems that even the development team themselves do not fully understand


 As with all logic flaws, try to identify what assumptions the developers have made and where the attack surface lies. You can then look for ways of violating these assumptions.
