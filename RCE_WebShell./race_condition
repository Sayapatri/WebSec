if the file is loaded into a temporary directory with a randomized name, in theory, it should be impossible for an attacker to exploit a
ny race conditions. If they don't know the name of the directory, they will be unable to request the file in order to trigger its execution.
On the other hand, if the randomized directory name is generated using pseudo-random functions like PHP's uniqid(), 
it can potentially be brute-forced.
