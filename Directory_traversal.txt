Directory traversal (also known as file path traversal) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to 
read arbitrary files on the server that is running an application. This might include application code and data, credentials 
for back-end systems, and sensitive operating system files. In some cases,
an attacker might be able to write to arbitrary files on the server, allowing them to modify application data or 
behavior, and ultimately take full control of the server..

You might be able to use nested traversal sequences, such as ....// or ....\/, which will revert to simple traversal sequences when the inner sequence is stripped.
You can sometimes bypass this kind of sanitization by URL encoding, or even double URL encoding, the ../ characters, resulting in %2e%2e%2f or %252e%252e%252f respectively. Various non-standard encodings, such as ..%c0%af or ..%ef%bc%8f, may also do the trick.
