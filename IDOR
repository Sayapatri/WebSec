Insecure direct object references (IDOR) are a subcategory of access control vulnerabilities. IDOR arises when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly and an attacker can modify the input to obtain unauthorized access. It was popularized by its appearance in the OWASP 2007 Top Ten although it is just one example of many implementation mistakes that can lead to access controls being circumvented.
