 OAuth grant type?
 =================
 The OAuth grant type determines the exact sequence of steps that are involved in the OAuth process. 
 The grant type also affects how the client application communicates with the OAuth service at each stage, including how the access token itself is sent.
 For this reason, grant types are often referred to as "OAuth flows".
